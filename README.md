# CPSC-4190 Team 12 - Senior Seminar Project

This repository showcases the final project developed by Team 12 (Sean Slaughter, Kevinn Blinn, Grayson Whitaker, and Chase Dun) for Clemson University's CPSC 4190 Senior Seminar. This project demonstrates our collective abilities in full-stack development and cloud deployment.

## Project Overview

Our project is a Truck Driver Rewards Web Application]. It was built using a modern technology stack and deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
This allows sponsor companies to reward their drivers points, which they can use directly to access an Ebay Catalog API to purchase items with their earned points.

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** React (deployed via AWS Amplify with automatic deployments and SSL certificates)
* **Backend:** AWS Lambda with Javascript
* **Database:** Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)
* **Authentication:** Amazon Cognito
* **Deployment & Hosting:** AWS Amplify
